#Additions / differences from last submition:

- main functionalities split into files, to increase readability / maintainability as noted. Added files:
    1. constants.js - in charge of global variables / constants for the project's operation
    2. initScreen.js - in charge of initializing the game's screen (creating the DOM elements that compose it), and it's layout is specified by the refined SCSS stylesheet.
    3. gameButtonsFunctionality - in charge of the logic behind the game buttons (startwar, fighter addition buttons).
