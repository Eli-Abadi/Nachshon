							 <b><i>The fall of Constantinople</i></b>, also known as <b><i>the conquest of Constantinople</i></b>, was the capture of the capital of the <strong>Byzantine Empire</strong> by the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong>.<br>
							The city was captured on May 29<sup>th</sup> 1453 as part of the culmination of a 53-day siege which had begun on April 6<sup>th</sup>.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The attacking Ottoman Army, which <i>significantly</i> outnumbered Constantinople's defenders, was commanded by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II (later nicknamed <i>"the Conqueror"</i>),<br>
							while the Byzantine army was led by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos.<br>
							After conquering the city, Mehmed II made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital, replacing Adrianople.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b><i>The conquest of Constantinople</i></b> and the fall of the Byzantine Empire was a watershed of the Late Middle Ages, marking the effective <strong>end of the Roman Empire</strong>,<br>
							a state which began in roughly 27<sub>BC</sub> and had lasted nearly 1500 years.

					<h2 style = "font-family:Arial;"> Historical Significance </h2>
					
						<p>
							 As it was the great Roman empire's fall, for many modern historians, the fall of Constantinople marks the end of the medieval period and the beginning of the early modern period.
						</p>
						
						<h4>
							Military Aspects:
						</h4>
						
							<p>
								The city's fall also stood as a turning point in military history.<br>
								Since ancient times, cities and castles had depended upon ramparts and walls to repel invaders. The Walls of Constantinople, especially the Theodosian Walls,<br>
								were some of the most advanced defensive systems in the world at the time.<br>
								For <i>800 years</i>, the Theodosian Walls, regarded by historians as the strongest and most fortified walls in the ancient and medieval era, protected Constantinople from attack.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								However, these fortifications were overcome with the use of gunpowder, specifically from Ottoman cannons and bombards, heralding a change in siege warfare
